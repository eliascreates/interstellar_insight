## Folder Structure

The Interstellar Insight app follows a Clean Architecture structure to separate concerns, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

- `lib/` contains the application code.
  - `feature/` houses the different features within the app.
    - `characters/` includes the Interstellar characters feature, containing all characters.
      - `data/` contains the data layer with repository and data source implementations.
      - `domain/` holds the domain layer with entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.
      - `presentation/` encompasses the presentation layer, including the user interface (UI), Business Logic Components (BLoCs), and other UI-related components.
    - `episodes/` showcases the Interstellar episodes feature.
    - `locations/` introduces the Interstellar locations feature, complete with all locations and notable resident characters.

## State Management

The Interstellar Insight app employs the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. This pattern allows for a clear separation of UI and business logic, offering an organized approach to manage the app's state.

## Data Source

The app fetches data from the "Final Space" API as the remote data source for JSON GET requests. The "Final Space" API provides data related to an animated TV series.
